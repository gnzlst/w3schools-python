# Comments can be used to explain Python code.

# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# Creating a Comment

# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
# Example
# Get your own Python Server
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
# Example
# Get your own Python Server
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
# Example
# Get your own Python Server
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Multiline Comments

# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
# Example
# Get your own Python Server
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
# Example
# Get your own Python Server
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")

# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
